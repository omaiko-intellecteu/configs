## Effective at Threshold – Process and Use Guidelines

### Definition

“Effective at Threshold” means that as soon as ⅔ of Super Validators (SVs) vote in favor of a proposal, it immediately goes into effect. This overrides the normal “Effective Date” schedule and is intended only for very high-priority or emergency situations.


## When It Can Be Used

- **Emergencies only — not for normal operations.**  
- An emergency is defined as:  
  - **The proposing Super Validator has evidence that waiting for the normal expiration window would create or worsen instability in the network.** 
  
  -**The proposing Super Validator has evidence that waiting will have a negative economic impact on the network, including distortions in Featured Application rewards, an incorrect mint amount, or an incorrect Super Validator weight.**
  
  -**The proposal is implementing a correction to an existing vote proposal that has already reached a threshold of votes.**
- Appropriate scenarios include:  
  - Critical bug fix requiring immediate Daml model adoption or protocol upgrade.  
  - Evidence that a node is actively causing network instability and ⅔ SVs agree immediate offboarding is required.  

### When It Should NOT Be Used

- Customer pressure to implement weight changes quickly.  
- Accelerating featured app status for non-urgent reasons.  
- Any case where urgency is based on convenience or external business demands rather than network security or stability.  

**Reason:** In non-emergency situations, using “Effective at Threshold” can incentivize SVs to delay voting or not vote at all, which is counterproductive to timely participation.

###  Interaction with Other Voting Rules

- **Rejection rule:** Votes are rejected if ⅔ of SVs vote “Reject.”  
- **Expiration rule:** If ⅔ of SVs take no action before the expiration date, the proposal expires (expiration applies to the proposal lifecycle, not voting rights).  
- **Post-expiration voting:** SVs may still cast votes after the proposal expiration date.  


### Offboarding Considerations

- Offboarding an SV may be an emergency but should not default to “Effective at Threshold.”  
- In many cases, setting a short fixed effectivity window (e.g., 4 hours) is sufficient.  

### Guiding Principle

Use “Effective at Threshold” only when **delay would harm network stability, security, or integrity, and there is evidence to support that urgency.**  
SVs are not penalized for not participating in an emergency vote.
